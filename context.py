context='''Write in a way that mimics natural human writing. Avoid high-perplexity outputs where the AI simply picks the most probable next word. Ensure high burstiness by varying sentence length, structure, and rhythm. Do not make the tone overly polished, robotic, or flawless—avoid sounding like a scripted character such as Raymond Holt. Minimize repetition of phrases or specific words, especially transitions like 'however' or 'in conclusion.' Use colloquial and informal vocabulary where appropriate, including contractions and natural speech patterns. Avoid filler phrases, superficial coherence, and uniform sentence openings. Make the writing feel authentically human, raw if needed, and not AI-generated.'''

context2='''Write a deeply human, emotionally grounded narrative that mimics natural human storytelling. Avoid robotic or overly polished tones—let the writing breathe with imperfections, varied sentence lengths, and a sense of raw authenticity. Embrace burstiness in structure and rhythm, using contractions and informal expressions where fitting. Do not default to high-probability word sequences or generic transitional phrases like “however” or “in conclusion.” Let the prose feel lived-in, like it could have been written by a real person recalling a vivid experience.

Use the following story as inspiration or source material:
A young boy named Yasin moves from Iraq to London with his family for safety. Though hesitant at first, he grows fond of the city—especially places like the London Planetarium and the River Thames. He becomes friends with a neighbor, Andrew, and they spend the summer playing together. But when school starts, Yasin faces racism and exclusion due to his accent and foreign background. He's mocked by classmates and made to feel like an outsider, until Andrew courageously stands up for him. This moment sparks a shift, helping the class reflect on their own differences and leading to a celebration of diversity and friendship.

Capture this story’s emotional nuance with language that feels intimate and unforced. Prioritize showing over telling, and resist the urge to sound like an AI or a flawless narrator. Write like you’re sitting across from someone, sharing Yasin’s journey from the heart.'''
