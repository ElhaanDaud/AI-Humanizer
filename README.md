AI Judges our content based on these criterias:
>Perplexity - Word1 Word2 Word3 - Ai tends to use the highest probable word possible to fit there as humans we tend not to use the same word
>Burstiness - Humans write with more variation in sentence length struct etc where as ai is uniform - High burstiness means more fluctuation 
>Consistent and polist - flawless everything that feels too suspicious like raymond holt type shit
>Repetition - Every LLM repeats some words again and again and its noticeable these days which is one of the give away (however , inconclusion)
>Safe Vocabulary - AI avoids colloquial words "A perfect example of colloquial language is a contraction, such as "ain't" for "is not" or "wasn't" for "was not". Another example of colloquial language is phrases such as "over yonder" when meaning "over there".
>Filler Phrases and Surface Level Coheerence
>Repetitive sentence opening
